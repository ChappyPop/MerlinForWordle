# MerlinForWordle
Your best friend to help out with Wordle (Python).
Consider Merlin not as a bot to solve your puzzle, but as a really smart freind, that you want to listen to, who does not forget.
If you know how to play Wordle, the menu is fairly self explanitory. Use Merlin as a companion, as you solve the puzzle online (on your phone). 
Generally: Start it up, run the analyis, pick a starter word, enter the starter word in Wordle, update Merlin with the results, select analysis, and repeat.
